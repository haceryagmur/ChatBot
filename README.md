The ChatBot project is an interactive application that uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to communicate with users. Itâ€™s designed to understand user inputs and respond with relevant answers based on predefined intents stored in a JSON file.

By using libraries like PyTorch and NLTK, the project effectively processes user input and generates appropriate responses.
